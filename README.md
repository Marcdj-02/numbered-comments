# Numbered comments

Numbering comments can improve the readability of the code and the flow of it. This extension aims to create a clear overview of these comments and aid the developer in adding and maintaining these.

**Features:**

* Shows the nested numbered comments in the sidebar for a clear overview

* Warns the developer if the numbering of the comments is inconsistant

Sidenote: Works even better with the [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens) extension
